So we have a total of 6 ways to make the GPUs faster, those are :

1. Control Divergence : ( that is called Removing conditionals )

2. Tiling : Online softmax explained  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpHjDoW4ffw


Another amazing repo by karpathy on writing custom GPU kernel code, see this here : https://github.com/karpathy/llm.c/


Softmax operation is a nice way to learn GPU operations , reduction operation on GPU , that is how we make GPU faster computation,
